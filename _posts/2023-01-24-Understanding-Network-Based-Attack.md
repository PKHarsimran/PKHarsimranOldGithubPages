# Types of Attacks:
Denial of Service (DoS) Attack
Protocol-Based Attack
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack


• Denial of Service (DoS) Attack: A type of cyber attack in which an attacker attempts to make a particular network resource or service unavailable to its intended users. This is typically done by overwhelming the target with a flood of network traffic or by targeting a specific aspect of the service that renders it unavailable.

• Protocol-Based Attack: A type of attack in which an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in a network protocol to gain unauthorized access to a network or to disrupt network communications. Examples of protocol-based attacks include TCP/IP hijacking and spoofing.
  
• Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack: A type of attack in which an attacker uses a large number of compromised devices, often referred to as "botnets," to launch a coordinated attack on a single target. DDoS attacks are often used to overwhelm a website or online service with traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
  
• Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack: A type of cyber attack in which an attacker intercepts and modifies communications between two parties. MitM attacks can be used to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials or credit card numbers, or to inject malware onto a victim's device.
  
It is important to note that these attacks can be mitigated with the use of security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and network segmentation. It's also important to keep software and systems up-to-date to fix any vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
