# What is network based attack you ask?:
A **network-based attack** is a type of cyber attack that targets a computer network or its infrastructure.
 These attacks typically exploit vulnerabilities in the network itself or in the systems connected to it.

Examples of network-based attacks include **denial-of-service (DoS) attacks**, **man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks**, **DDoS**, and **Protocol based attack**. 
 
The goal of these attacks can range from disrupting network traffic to stealing sensitive data. To protect against network-based attacks, organizations should implement strong security measures such as **firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and regular security updates.**

In addition to the measures mentioned above, organizations can also take proactive steps such as regularly conducting vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify and address potential weaknesses in their network before an attacker can exploit them.

Another important aspect of protecting against network-based attacks is employee education and awareness. Employees should be trained on best practices for network security, such as using strong passwords and avoiding suspicious emails and attachments.

It is also important to regularly backup critical data and keep software and systems up-to-date with the latest security patches. This helps to minimize the impact of a successful attack and facilitates a faster recovery.

In conclusion, network-based attacks are a serious threat to organizations and can have far-reaching consequences. By taking proactive measures to secure their networks, organizations can protect themselves against these types of attacks and ensure the safety of their sensitive information.
