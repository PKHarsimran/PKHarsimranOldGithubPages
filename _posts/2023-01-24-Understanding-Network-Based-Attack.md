# What is network based attack you ask?:

A **network-based attack** is a type of cyber attack that targets a computer network or its infrastructure.
 These attacks typically exploit vulnerabilities in the network itself or in the systems connected to it.

Examples of network-based attacks include **denial-of-service (DoS) attacks**, **man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks**, **DDoS**, and **Protocol based attack**. 
 
The goal of these attacks can range from disrupting network traffic to stealing sensitive data. To protect against network-based attacks, organizations should implement strong security measures such as **firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and regular security updates.**
