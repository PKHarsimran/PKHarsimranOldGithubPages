## Streamlining Cortex Agent Updates with Python Automation

### The Problem: A Need for Automation

In our daily operations, keeping track of Cortex agent updates was becoming cumbersome. Cortex doesn't offer built-in notifications for updates, leaving us in a bind. As our team heavily relies on Jira for project management, the need for a centralized alert system became clear.

### Why Python? 

Python was the logical choice due to its ease of use and rich library ecosystem. If you're just starting out with Python, the script is straightforward to understand and deploy.

### Challenges and Solutions

Initially, the script was designed to run indefinitely to monitor updates. However, this wasn't efficient for our requirements. To improve this, the script has been configured to be run by `cron`, allowing for more flexible scheduling.

### How It Works: A Closer Look

Upon execution, the script generates a log file for tracking its activities. It also produces a `hash.txt` file, serving as a reference point for future comparisons. This way, we can easily identify if an update has occurred on the Cortex agent.

### Whatâ€™s Next: Jira Integration

The next step is integrating Jira to receive automated alerts. This will not only streamline our workflow but also create a centralized platform for all team members to stay updated.

### Conclusion: The Power of Programming

Creating this Python script was both challenging and rewarding. If you're new to the field, take this as a reminder that programming offers a versatile toolset for solving a wide range of problems. Additionally, numerous online resources and AI tools are available to assist you.
