# What is Azure ?
Azure is a cloud computing platform developed by Microsoft, similar to other cloud services like Google Cloud and AWS. If you're new to Azure, it may take some time to get familiar with how it works. However, in my experience, it's a great platform to launch your cloud-based projects. Over the past year, I've used Azure to deploy virtual machines, WordPress sites, and even set up a jump box to enhance security. In this blog, I'll be sharing some valuable insights that I've gained while using Azure.

# Github pages to Azure


For over a year, I have been utilizing GitHub Pages to create free blogs for my various projects. It's an excellent platform for creating and sharing content. To get started, I forked the Jekyll repository from Barry Clark and followed the tutorial to set up GitHub pages. Once I had my website up and running on GitHub, I decided to explore Azure.

To understand how Azure works, I took advantage of the free documentation available from Microsoft and spent a lot of time practicing. Using Azure web apps, I was able to deploy [my website](https://pkharsimran.github.io/) on Azure and even add my own custom domains. Additionally, Azure provides analytics services, which allowed me to gather in-depth data on my website traffic, such as how many users visited my site and how long they stayed. In this blog, I'll be sharing my experience of moving from GitHub Pages to Azure and some tips for making the transition smoothly.

Some benefits of using azure static web apps ------>

- Global hosting (you have option to deploy your site closer to your targeted customers for faster speed and more!)
- Any [front-end language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/front-end-frameworks) works!
- Pay as you grow. So my domain cost me $20 and I pay $1 monthly to host it on azure ;)
