# Whatâ€™s Up with Azure?
Hey folks! Today, weâ€™re diving into Azure, a cloud computing platform from Microsoft. Itâ€™s on the same wavelength as Google Cloud and AWS. If Azure is new to you, no worriesâ€”it might take a little time to figure it out, but trust me, itâ€™s a cool tool for all your cloud-based projects. Iâ€™ve been playing around with Azure for the past year, setting up virtual machines, launching WordPress sites, and even creating a jump box for extra security. Stick around as I share some cool stuff Iâ€™ve learned using Azure!

## Shifting from GitHub Pages to Azure
For over a year, Iâ€™ve been using GitHub Pages to put together free blogs for different projects. Itâ€™s been a great space for making and sharing stuff. I started by forking the Jekyll repository from Barry Clark and followed a guide to get my GitHub pages going. After getting my website up on GitHub, I got curious about Azure.

To get the hang of Azure, I dove into the free guides from Microsoft and practiced a bunch. Using Azure web apps, I got [my website](https://pkharsimran.github.io/) live on Azure, even with my custom domains! Plus, Azureâ€™s got analytics services, helping me see how many people are checking out my site and what theyâ€™re looking at. In this post, Iâ€™ll share how I moved from GitHub Pages to Azure and give you some tips to make your move smooth too.

### Why Azure Static Web Apps Rock!

- **Worldwide Hosting:** You can put your site closer to your peeps for faster speed. Thatâ€™s a win!
- **All Front-end Languages Welcome:** Any [front-end language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/front-end-frameworks) works here!
- **Budget-Friendly:** My domain cost $20, and I pay just $1 each month to keep it on Azure. ðŸ˜‰

Thatâ€™s it for now! Iâ€™ll be back with more of my Azure journey and tips to help you get started.
