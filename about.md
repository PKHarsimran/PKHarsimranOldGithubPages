   "I am a passionate coder with a love for creating and experimenting with new technologies." 
    
My experience includes working with embedded microcontrollers such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, as well as reverse engineering small electrical equipment. I have also built my own Internet of Things (IoT) devices using ESP32 and ESP8266 development boards. 
I am currently expanding my skills by experimenting with cloud computing on Azure, and am always looking to improve and expand my knowledge. Additionally, I suffer from CPTSD (complex post-traumatic stress disorder) and am passionate about promoting mental health awareness and advocacy. 
I also have a strong interest in self-help and personal development and enjoy reading about these topics.
