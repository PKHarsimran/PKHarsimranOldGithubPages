Hello and welcome to my blog! I am an enthusiastic engineer with extensive experience in working with embedded microcontrollers such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi. My passion for technology extends to reverse engineering small electrical equipment and building my own Internet of Things (IoT) devices using ESP32 and ESP8266 development boards.

As I continually strive to expand my skills, I have been delving into the world of cloud computing with a particular focus on Azure. My thirst for knowledge drives me to constantly improve and broaden my expertise in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

On a personal note, I have been living with CPTSD (complex post-traumatic stress disorder) and have made it my mission to promote mental health awareness and advocacy. I strongly believe in the power of self-help and personal development, and I am an avid reader of books and articles on these topics. Through my blog, I aim to share my experiences, insights, and learnings, hoping to inspire and support others who are on a similar journey.

Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you find value in the content I share. Please feel free to connect with me. I look forward to engaging with you and learning from your experiences as well!
